# Racing Project by DERONNE Mathis and NAVARRO Mathias

## Overview
The idea behind this project is to demonstrate our understanding of the basics of the Unity game engine.

## Gameplay
- Upon launching the game, you'll be presented with two options: quit or start playing.
- While playing:
  - Control your car using the following keys:
    - **Forward:** Z
    - **Slow down:** Q
    - **Backwards:** S
    - **Turn:** D
  - The circuit will be enclosed with barriers, where collisions will act as walls.

## Pause Menu
- Pressing `ESC` will pause the game, accessing the pause menu with the following options:
  - **Restart:** Takes you back to the start of the circuit.
  - **Continue:** Resumes the game, exiting the pause menu.
  - **Quit:** Returns you to the home screen.

Feel free to adjust the formatting and add more details or sections as needed for your project!
